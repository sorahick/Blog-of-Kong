# **Self-Introduction**
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>I'm Kong from China. Here's my brief bio: I majored in clinical medicine and earn my Bachelor degree in Sun Yat-sen University. Now I'm a doctoral candidate and hopefully I can earn my doctoral degree few years later.</p>
<p>Frankly, just a few months ago, I virtually knew nothing about coding and bioinformatics. What boosts me to learn is not just interests but the potential I sees that one day, Bioinformatics, or, in a broader sense, data science, will forever change  our understanding about the world and give us unimaginable strength in eradicating diseases and poverty. It would be nice to be part of this historical transformation.</p>
<p>One of the main purpose of establishing this blog is to mark down and share what I have learned, tried and err and hopefully I can find someone who share the same vista.</p>
